# PI-Works

In this notebook, I tackled the problem with a basic approach, it was a busy week and I was sick, I am sorry for that, I can do better if you give me more time. I know the forecasting methods theoretically but this is the first time I actually applied it. 

I applied some forecasting methods, moving average, bats, tbats, arima and lstm. I applied linear interpolation to fill missing values. I could not try performance of other interpolation methods. I splitted the municipalities and train them separately. I interpolated test data also, probably I should not include that data to scoring method, I aware that. Also I did not use actual values for the last week of the test data, probably it can increase the performance.

For deep learning approach, I wanted to try another architectures, but I could try only 2 different models for lstm. 
For ARIMA, parameter optimization could be done.
